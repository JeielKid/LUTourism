            La Union is known for its large produce of luscious grapes. But how
            do grapes thrive in such a tropical climate like the Philippines?
            All things are made possible from continuous research and hard work
            from the grape king of the Philippines, Mr. Avelino A. Lomboy.
            (Lomboy Farms, 2015)<br /><br />It was back in the 1970s when
            viticulture, the study of grapes and its production, was introduced
            in the Philippines. The pioneer vineyards first started in the
            Visayas and Mindanao region; but due to disease epidemics and poor
            output in the area, these enterprises were ceased later on.<br /><br />During
            1972, Mr. Avelino A. Lomboy started planting his first 20 cuttings
            on his backyard. After years of various research and trial and
            error, the vines bore fruit and today most of the grapes are
            produced in La Union. (Lomboy Farms, 2015)<br /><br />How to go to
            Bauang, La Union from Manila?<br /><br />
            Visiting the grapes farm of La Union from Manila is easy, here’s
            how: If you’re traveling with a private vehicle, then use the free
            navigational apps like Waze or Google Maps. Upon arrival in the
            location, there are guides waiting on the side of the Manila
            National Road. Ask assistance and they will surely help you.
