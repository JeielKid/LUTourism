              also served as the trailblazer for the establishment of other
              family-owned grape farms, including likewise widely visited Gapuz
              Grape Farm.

            <h3>DJ RIVERA</h3>
            <p>
              Besides San Juan surf town's beach and fat waves, Tangadan Falls
              in the forests of neighboring San Gabriel town is also a
              frequented destination in La Union. Most Elyu trips, if not all,
              include this water cascade in their itineraries. <br /><br />
              We hopped on our rented Hi-ace van right after breakfast on that
              gloomy Sunday. We're headed to Tangadan Falls, or so we thought.
              Kuya Jim, our driver who has driven many times to La Union but
              never been to San Gabriel, asked the locals and fellow drivers in
              San Juan for directions before we left. And so we went.

            <h3>BLAINE LUCERO</h3>
            <p>
              Most of the grape farm in La Union are located in the municipality
              of Bauang. We decided to visit the Gapuz Grapes Farm before
              heading to the beautiful beaches of San Juan. At the location, we
              met the locals and they showed the direction going to the farm.
              <br /><br />
              Gapuz Grapes Farm greeted us with rows of attractive green
              vineyards. As picturesque and sweet as it may seem, the highlights
              are found in its fruit – the charming ripe, sun-drenched grapes.
              The farmers tending the place offered us their tangy and sweet
              produce.
